"""Helper functions to process the raw data"""
# Insert functions to process the raw data. These functions should also save the processed data to PROCESSED_DATA_DIR.
# Call these functions in src.data.build.py to the master build() function.
# Don't include MODELING helper processing functions (place these in src.modeling.process.py instead).
# If many processing functions are needed, consider splitting them into multiple modules in the src.data.process folder.
